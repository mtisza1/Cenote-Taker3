# Cenote-Taker3

Discover and annotate the virome

`Cenote-Taker 3` is a bioinformatics tools that scales from individual genomes sequences to massive metagenome assemblies to:

1)  Identify sequences containing genes specific to viruses (virus hallmark genes)

2)  Annotate virus sequences including:

-a) adaptive ORF calling

-b) a large catalog of HMMs from virus gene families

-c) Hierarchical taxonomy assignment based on hallmark genes

-d) mmseqs2-based CDD database search

-e) tabular and interactive genome map (.gbf) outputs

**Also, `Cenote-Taker 3` is very fast, many many times faster than `Cenote-Taker 2`, and faster than comparable annotation using `pharokka`**
